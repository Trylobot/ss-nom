**TO DO:**

Lore
  * text descriptions for all things that are missing one
  * long descriptions for all ships, with a cutoff at the appropriate place to fit in the two possible display areas

Balance
  * roadrunner - enact a peak active timer like the Medusa
  * general shield efficacy + vent time audit on all ships

Music
  * either combat, campaign or elsewhere: Sheherazade by wnm (edited for looping)
